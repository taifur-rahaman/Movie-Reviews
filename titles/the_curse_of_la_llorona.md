## Overview

**The Curse of La Llorona** brings the legendary Mexican figure of "The Weeping Woman" into the Conjuring Universe (tangentially). Set in 1973 Los Angeles, a social worker trying to protect two children from what she thinks is parental abuse discovers that a supernatural entity is actually hunting them.

## Story & Atmosphere

The film attempts to blend a police procedural with supernatural folklore. The premise is strong—a social worker inadvertently causing the death of children by "saving" them from their protective mother—but the execution is generic.

The scares are loud and frequent but rarely scary. It relies on the "quiet... quiet... BANG" formula. The atmosphere lacks the specific cultural texture it needs; despite dealing with Mexican folklore, it feels very Hollywood.

## Performances & Direction

**Linda Cardellini** is the best thing about this movie. She is a fantastic actress who elevates the material, playing a fierce, protective mother.

**Raymond Cruz** plays a *curandero* (folk healer), bringing some much-needed personality and humor to the film. His unconventional methods (using eggs to detect evil) are the most interesting parts of the lore.

**Michael Chaves** (who later directed *The Conjuring 3* and *The Nun 2*) directs this one. It feels very safe and studio-mandated, lacking a unique voice.

## Folklore & Mythology

### The Legend of La Llorona
La Llorona is one of the most famous figures in Mexican folklore. The story goes that a woman named Maria drowned her children in a river in a fit of rage/jealousy against her husband, then drowned herself. She is cursed to roam the earth, weeping ("Ay, mis hijos!") and looking for children to replace her own. The film stays true to the basics of this legend.

### Curanderismo
The film introduces an intermediary who is not a Catholic priest but a *curandero*—a traditional folk healer. He uses a mix of Catholic syncretism and indigenous practices (shamanism, herbalism) to fight the spirit. This was a refreshing change from the usual Latin-speaking priests of the franchise.

### The Connection to Conjuring
The only real connection is **Father Perez** (Tony Amendola), who appeared in the first *Annabelle* movie. He mentions his experience with the doll, confirming this takes place in the same universe. Otherwise, it feels like a standalone movie.

## Verdict

**The Curse of La Llorona** is the weakest entry in the universe. It wastes a terrifying piece of authentic folklore on a generic jump-scare fest. It’s watchable thanks to Linda Cardellini, but it’s completely inessential to the wider storyline.

**Rating: ★★☆☆☆ (4.5/10)**

## Personal Notes & Observations

-   **The Eggs**: The scene where the *curandero* uses eggs to cleanse the house is a cool detail grounded in real folk magic.
-   **The Weeping**: The sound design of her crying is effective, even if the jump scares aren't.

### Viewing Progress

**Completed (Past Viewing):**
-   Feels like a missed opportunity to make a truly scary movie about this legend.
-   Michael Chaves improved significantly with *The Nun 2*.
