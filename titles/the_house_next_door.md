## Overview

The House Next Door (known as "Aval" in Tamil and "Gruham" in Telugu) is a supernatural horror thriller that follows a neurosurgeon and his wife whose peaceful life in the Himalayas gets disrupted when a new family moves into the neighboring house. What starts as friendly neighborly interactions quickly spirals into terrifying paranormal events centered around the new family's teenage daughter, leading to questions about possession, revenge, and the dark history of the house next door.

## Story & Atmosphere

The film opens with Dr. Krishnakant (Siddharth) and his wife Lakshmi (Andrea Jeremiah) living a serene life in a beautiful Himalayan setting. The isolation and tranquility of their mountain home is established early—it's the kind of place you'd move to for peace and quiet, far from the chaos of city life.

That peace shatters when the D'Costa family—Paul (Atul Kulkarni), his wife, and their rebellious teenage daughter Jennifer (Anisha Victor)—moves into the house next door. The house itself has history: it was previously occupied by a mother and daughter back in 1934, and there's an immediate sense that something about this place is *off*.

The film starts fine with a decent enough plot setup. The Himalayan setting works well for the premise—the isolation, the mist-covered mountains, the old architecture. Jennifer becomes the focal point of the supernatural activity, with the film exploring possession and the dark history of the house.

However, the execution falls flat. Despite being a horror film, it's not scary at all. There are some jump scares thrown in, but they're pretty lame and predictable. The film lacks the tension and atmosphere needed to make the horror elements work.

The biggest problem is the ending—it feels incredibly rushed and poorly made. After a slow build-up, the resolution comes too quickly and doesn't land with any impact. It's like they ran out of time or budget and just wrapped things up hastily.

## Performances & Direction

Milind Rau (who also co-wrote the film with Siddharth) shows strong directorial control. The film doesn't rush into the horror—it takes time to establish the characters, their relationships, and the setting before things go sideways.

**Siddharth** as Dr. Krishna brings a grounded, rational presence to the film. As someone who co-wrote and co-produced the project, he's clearly invested in the material. His character serves as the audience's entry point—the skeptic who has to confront things that challenge his scientific worldview.

**Andrea Jeremiah** as Lakshmi provides emotional depth. Her character seems to sense the danger before her husband fully accepts it, creating that classic horror dynamic where someone knows something's wrong but struggles to convince others.

**Anisha Victor** as Jennifer has the challenging role of playing someone who may or may not be possessed. The performance requires switching between normal teenage behavior and something far more sinister.

**Atul Kulkarni** as Paul, the father dealing with his daughter's terrifying transformation, brings gravitas to the parental desperation angle.

The cinematography takes full advantage of the Himalayan location—beautiful yet isolating, serene yet ominous. The contrast between the stunning natural beauty and the horror unfolding within these houses creates effective visual tension.

## Themes & Impact

The film attempts to explore:
- **Science vs. Supernatural**: Krishna's medical background versus unexplainable events
- **Past trauma and revenge**: The 1934 history of the house and how past sins echo into the present
- **Possession and identity**: Questions about what's happening to Jennifer
- **Isolation**: How the remote setting amplifies the horror

Unfortunately, these themes don't really land with much impact. The rushed ending undermines whatever the film was trying to build, and the lack of genuine scares means the horror elements fail to engage. It's a decent concept that just doesn't come together in execution.

## Verdict

The House Next Door (Aval) is a frustrating example of wasted potential. The film has all the ingredients for a solid horror experience—a beautiful Himalayan setting, strong production values, competent performances, and an interesting premise rooted in possession and past trauma. The setup is genuinely promising, with the isolated mountain location and the mysterious history of the house next door creating an atmosphere ripe for supernatural terror.

But the execution falls flat where it matters most: the horror itself. For a film that's supposed to scare you, it's shockingly not scary. The jump scares are predictable and lame, lacking the tension and buildup needed to make them effective. The film never manages to create genuine dread or unease despite having all the right atmospheric elements in place.

The biggest problem is the ending. After a slow build-up that takes its time establishing characters and setting, the resolution feels incredibly rushed and poorly constructed. It's like the filmmakers ran out of time or budget and just wrapped things up as quickly as possible. The payoff doesn't justify the investment, leaving you feeling like you sat through over two hours for nothing.

Credit where it's due: the film doesn't look cheap. The cinematography is solid, the Himalayan locations are gorgeous, and the multilingual release (Tamil/Hindi/Telugu) shows genuine ambition. The cast does what they can with the material, and Siddharth's involvement as co-writer and co-producer suggests this was a passion project. But ambition and good intentions don't make up for fundamental failures in execution.

The film tries to bridge Western possession horror conventions with Indian cultural elements, but it doesn't commit strongly enough to either approach. It's caught in a middle ground where it's not scary enough to work as pure horror and not interesting enough thematically to work as a supernatural drama.

**Final Thought:** A decent setup and nice production values can't save a horror film that isn't scary and ends with a whimper instead of a bang. Skip it.

**Rating: ★★⯪☆☆ (2.5/5)** - Wasted potential. Good setup and production values undermined by lack of scares and a rushed, poorly executed ending.

**Would I watch again?** No. Won't rewatch.

## Additional Context: Background & Production

"The House Next Door" was released simultaneously in three languages—Tamil (as "Aval"), Hindi (as "The House Next Door"), and Telugu (as "Gruham")—showing the filmmakers' ambition to reach audiences across India. 

The film was directed by Milind Rau and co-written by Rau and lead actor Siddharth, who also co-produced the project. This level of creative control from the lead actor suggests a passion project rather than just another commercial horror film.

The choice to set the film in the Himalayas rather than the typical haunted mansion or urban setting gives it a unique visual identity. The isolation of the mountain location serves both practical and thematic purposes—it's beautiful enough to justify why someone would live there, but remote enough that when things go wrong, help isn't readily available.

The film draws on possession horror traditions while incorporating Indian cultural and spiritual elements, attempting to bridge Western horror conventions with regional storytelling approaches.
