## Overview

**The Conjuring 2** sees Ed and Lorraine Warren travel to London to tackle one of the most documented paranormal cases in history: the Enfield Poltergeist. A single mother and her four children are besieged by a malicious spirit, but Lorraine fears a greater evil is pulling the strings—a demon nun that has been haunting her visions.

## Story & Atmosphere

Sequels rarely live up to the original, but *The Conjuring 2* comes very close. It shifts the setting from a secluded farmhouse to a cramped, rainy council house in London, which changes the texture of the horror. It feels grittier and more claustrophobic.

The film does a great job of balancing two threats: the spirit of the old man, Bill Wilkins, who haunts the family, and the shadowy demon Valak. The scene where Ed interviews "Bill" through the young girl, Janet, is a masterclass in tension. The "Crooked Man" sequence adds a touch of dark fairytale horror that divides audiences (some find it CGI-heavy, others find it unnerving), but it shows Wan's willingness to experiment.

## Performances & Direction

**Madison Wolfe** gives a phenomenal performance as Janet Hodgson, the young girl at the center of the possession. She conveys fear and exhaustion perfectly.

**Patrick Wilson** gets a standout moment singing Elvis's "Can't Help Falling in Love," which serves a crucial narrative purpose—reminding us (and the family) of the warmth and love they are fighting to protect. It’s a beautiful character beat in a horror movie.

**James Wan** directs with confidence. The painting scene with the Nun is one of the scariest sequences in the entire franchise. The way he plays with shadows and composition is brilliant.

## Folklore & Mythology

### The Enfield Poltergeist
This is a real historical case from 1977-1979 unless you think it was a hoax (which many do). The film acknowledges the skepticism, incorporating purely investigative scenes. The real recordings of Janet speaking in the "Bill" voice are used in the credits, which adds a heavy dose of reality.

### Valak (The Nun)
The film introduces Valak, a major antagonist. In demonology (The Lesser Key of Solomon), Valak is a Great President of Hell, often depicted as a winged boy riding a two-headed dragon. The film reimagines Valak as a nun to blaspheme Lorraine's faith and attack her spiritually. It’s a terrifying design choice that became instantly iconic.

### The Crooked Man
Based on an old English nursery rhyme ("There was a crooked man..."). While seemingly random, it fits the theme of the entity manifesting from the children's fears and toys (the zoetrope).

### Spiritual Mockery
The film emphasizes that demons often mock religious figures and relationships. Valak disguises itself to turn Ed and Lorraine’s love and faith against them.

## Verdict

**The Conjuring 2** is a powerhouse sequel. It’s longer and louder than the first, but it retains the emotional core that makes these movies work. The villain (Valak) is terrifying, the setting is unique, and the bond between the Warrens is stronger than ever.

**Rating: ★★★★☆ (8/10)**

## Personal Notes & Observations

-   **The Painting**: The reveal of the Nun standing in the shadow of the painting is peak horror filmmaking.
-   **Elvis Scene**: I unironically love that scene. It effectively raises the stakes because you care about the characters.
-   **Bill Wilkins**: "This is my house!" The voice acting for the possession is chilling.

### Viewing Progress

**Completed (Past Viewing):**
-   Proves that James Wan is not a one-hit wonder.
-   Solidifies Valak as a top-tier horror icon.
