## Overview

**Annabelle Comes Home** is essentially "Night at the Museum" but with excessive demonic activity. It takes place entirely within the Warrens' house over the course of one night, where their daughter Judy, her babysitter, and a curious friend accidentally unleash the spirits trapped in the artifact room.

## Story & Atmosphere

The premise is fun: what happens when the containment fails? The film functions as a monster mash, showcasing a variety of cursed objects like the Ferryman, a Hellhound, and a haunted Samurai suit. It’s less about deep dread and more about a haunted house ride.

The atmosphere is lighter than the main *Conjuring* films, feeling almost like a teen horror movie (which it is). It’s scary but manageable, focusing on the resourcefulness of the three young leads.

## Performances & Direction

**Mckenna Grace** is excellent as Judy Warren. She plays the role with a maturity that anchors the film, showing the burden of growing up with "weird" parents.

**Vera Farmiga** and **Patrick Wilson** appear in bookend scenes, which immediately elevates the movie, even if they aren't the focus.

**Gary Dauberman** (writer of previous films) steps into the director’s chair. He handles the geography of the house well, creating tension in familiar spaces.

## Folklore & Mythology

### The Artifact Room
This room is the centerpiece of the Warrens' lore. In reality, they did keep a museum in their basement filled with cursed objects. The film emphasizes that these objects aren't "evil" themselves, but are used by spirits as anchors to the physical world.

### The Beacon
The film clarifies Annabelle's true nature: she isn't just a possessed doll; she is a "beacon" for other spirits. Her presence amplifies paranormal activity, which is why she is kept in a case made of chapel glass and blessed weekly.

### The Ferryman
One of the standout new entities is the Ferryman (Charon from Greek mythology), who requires coins placed on the eyes of the dead to transport souls. The film twists this into a terrifying entity that collects souls.

## Verdict

**Annabelle Comes Home** is a fun, spooky entry that doesn't take itself too seriously. It’s a great showcase for the wider lore of the Warrens' cases without needing a complex plot. It’s distinctly "cozy horror"—scary, but safe.

**Rating: ★★★☆☆ (6/10)**

## Personal Notes & Observations

-   **The Future Game**: The scene with the TV predicting the future is a clever, creepy concept.
-   **The Hellhound**: The CGI werewolf/hellhound is a bit weak, but the fog effects help.
